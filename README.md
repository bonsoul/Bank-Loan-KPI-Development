# Bank-Loan-KPI-Development

I leverage SQL queries extensively to develop key performance indicators (KPIs) for bank loan analysis. These KPIs encompass critical metrics such as Loan Amount, Loan Received Amount, Payable Amount, Average Interest, and Debt-to-Income Ratio. By structuring and querying vast datasets, I extract and manipulate pertinent information to generate actionable insights for loan portfolio management and risk assessment.
